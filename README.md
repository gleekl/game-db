# Project #2: Full-Stack Application

## [Games-DB](https://game-database-app.herokuapp.com/games).

In Games-DB, you can add video games or tabletop games you have played, are playing, or want to play into your own personal playlist.


#### Tech Stack 

What I used for Games-DB:
- **Node.js**
- **Express**
- **MongoDB**
- **Mongoose.**
- **EJS**
- **Bootstrap**

## Features

1. Burger menu for mobile or reduced desktop window sizes.
1. Sign up and log in/out function.
1. JavaScript functions that split inputs into arrays to be split into individual elements for future search functions. E.g. 'Genre' = rpg, 
1. Embedded an iframe which allows a full 3D view of 3D tabletop game models.


## Improvements to be made

1. Search functionality - Improve genre/platform/mode/tags link search functionality so that users can click a genre/platform etc. and will be redirected to the clicked genre/platform. E.g. User A clicks on the First-Person Shooter genre and it redirects to all the First-Person Shooter games or Person B clicks the Strategy genre in a board game's description page and it redirects to a list of games with the Strategy genre.
1. Home page - Create a proper home page instead of a video games page redirect.
1. Incorporating proper dynamic links to 3D model for the Tabletop iframe view.
1. Playlist - Continue working on allowing users to add the games in the community-sourced database
